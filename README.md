# CSMF_Data_Challenge
The 2016 Clinical Statistics Methods Forum Data Challenge Repository

The directory contains two data sets:

1. TRAIN.CSV: The training data with baseline clinical variables and the outcome of interest (therapeutic dose)
2. VALID.CSV: The validation data with baseline clinical variables only
 
The introduction presentation in both R Markdown and PDF format is included. The R Markdown file uses the default Beamer style so it can be compiled without the custom Mayo Beamer style.
